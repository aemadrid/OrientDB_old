<p>Orient DB is a document DBMS. The <a href="key_value_server.html">Orient KeyValue Server</a> and the <a href="object_database.html">Orient Object Database</a> are built on top of this functionality. </p>
<p><img src="http://www.orientechnologies.com/images/orientdb-architecture.png"></p>
<p>The ODatabase class provides the main APIs an application uses. ODatabase communicates with a OStorage class implementation that stores physically the records. </p>
<p>There are three OStorage implementations: </p>
<ul>
<li>
<strong>Local</strong>: reads and writes records on the local file system </li>
<li>
<strong>Remote</strong>: acts as a proxy that sends and receives all the requests to a remote Orient DB Server instance </li>
<li>
<strong>Memory</strong>: keeps all records in memory </li>
</ul>
