It's written in Java and it's amazing fast: can store        up to 150,000 records per second on common hardware. Even if it's        Document based database the relationships are managed as in Graph        Databases with direct connections among records. You can traverse entire        or part of trees and graphs of records in few milliseconds. Supports        schema-less, schema-full and schema-mixed modes. Has a strong security        profiling system based on user and roles and support the SQL between the        query languages. Thank to the SQL layer it's straightforward to use it        for people skilled in Relational world.        Is OrientDB a Relational DBMS?        No. OrientDB adheres to the NoSQL movement even if supports a subset of        SQL as query language. In this way it's easy to start using it without        to learn too much new stuff. OrientDB is a Document Database but has the        best features of other DBMSs. For example the relationships are handled        as in the Graph Databases.        Scalability: the database is the bottleneck of most of applications        The most common problem why applications scale out bad is, very often,        the database. Database is the bottleneck of most of applications.        OrientDB scales out very well on a single machine. A single server makes        the work of about 125 servers running MySQL. The transactional engine        can run in distributed systems supporting up to 9.223.372.036 Billions        of records for the maximum capacity of 19.807.040.628.566.084 Terabytes        of data distributed on multiple disks in multiple nodes. Today only        OrientDB Key/Value Server can run in a cluster with thousands of        instances using a Distributed Hash Table algorithm. We're developing the        distributed version of OrientDB as well.        I can't believe! Why it's so fast?        OrientDB has been designed to be very fast. It inherits the best        features and concepts from the Object Databases, Graph DBMS and the        modern NoSQL engines. Furthermore it uses the own RB+Tree algorithm as        mix of Red-Black Tree and B+Tree. RB+Tree consumes about half memory of        the Red-Black Tree implementation mantaining the original speed while it        balances the tree on insertion/update. Furthermore the RB+Tree allows        fast retrieving and storing of nodes in persistent way.        But OrientDB wasn't a ODBMS?        Orient ODBMS was the very first version of the Orient engine developed        in C++ in 1998. Today OrientDB has been totally rewritten in Java under        the form of a Document database but with the previous main goal:        performance. However now you can find the Object Database, but it's a        wrapper built on top of the Document Database. It maps transparently        OrientDB document records with POJOs.        Easy to install and use        Yes. OrientDB is totally written in Java and can run in any platform        without configuration and installation. The full Server distribution is        about 1Mb without the demo database.        Know more        Start to learn OrientDB from the WiKi Main page.
