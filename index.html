        <h2>Super fast</h2>
        <p>On common hardware stores up to 150.000 documents per second, 10 billions of documents per day. Big Graphs are loaded in few milliseconds without executing costly JOIN such as the Relational DBMSs.</p>
        <p>OrientDB uses a new indexing algorithm called MVRB-Tree, derived from the Red-Black Tree and from the B+Tree with benefits of both: fast insertion and ultra fast lookup.</p>
