<p>Starting from 0.9.19 the "Object Database" implementation supports natively the inheritance between classes taken by the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inheritance_%28object-oriented_programming%29" rel="nofollow">Object Orientation paradigm</a>. </p>
<p>OrientDB doesn't split Documents between different classes (as many OR-Mapping tools do). Each Document will reside in the cluster of its most base class. When you execute a query against a class that has sub-classes, OrientDB will search into the clusters of the target class and all its sub-classes. To know more see <a href="#How_it_works">How it works</a>. </p>
<h3>
<a name="Declare_in_schema"></a>Declare in schema<a href="#Declare_in_schema" class="section_anchor"></a>
</h3>
<p>OrientDB needs to know the relationships between the class inheritance. Note that this is an abstract concept that applies to both <a href="object_database.html#Inheritance">POJOs</a> and  <a href="document_database.html#Inheritance">Documents</a>. </p>
<p>Example: </p>
<pre class="prettyprint">OClass account = database.getMetadata().getSchema().createClass("Account");
OClass company = database.getMetadata().getSchema().createClass("Company").setSuperClass(account);</pre>
<h3>
<a name="Polymorphic_Queries"></a>Polymorphic Queries<a href="#Polymorphic_Queries" class="section_anchor"></a>
</h3>
<p>By default all the query are polymorphics. Using the example above with this SQL query: </p>
<pre class="prettyprint">SELECT FROM account WHERE name = 'Google'</pre>
<p>Will be returned all the instances of Account and Company classes that has the property name equals to "Google". </p>
<h3>
<a name="How_it_works"></a>How it works<a href="#How_it_works" class="section_anchor"></a>
</h3>
<p>Consider this example. We have 3 classes, with the cluster-id between paranthesis: </p>
<p><tt>Account(10) &lt;|--- Company (13) &lt;|--- OrientTechnologiesGroup (27)</tt> </p>
<p>OrientDB, by default, creates a separate cluster for each class (NOTE: <i>pay attention that by default is "logical". To improve performance use physical cluster!</i>). </p>
<p>This cluster is indicated by the "<strong>defaultClusterId</strong>" property in OClass class and indicates the cluster used by default when not specified. However the OClass has the property "<strong>clusterIds</strong>" (as int<a href=""></a>) that contains all the clusters able to host the records of that class. </p>
<p>By default "clusterIds" and "defaultClusterId" are the same. </p>
<p>When you execute a query against a class, OrientDB limits the result sets only to the records of the clusters contained in the "clusterIds" property. </p>
<p>In this way when you execute this: </p>
<pre class="prettyprint">SELECT FROM Account WHERE name.toUpperCase() = 'GOOGLE'</pre>
<p>Will returns all the records for "GOOGLE" contained in all the three classes because for the class "Account" OrientDB searches inside the clusters 10, 13 and 27 following the inheritance specified in the schema. </p>
